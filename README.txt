To ensure the project runs I suggest dropping any existing tables so the correct ones can be created. Database names are AuthenticationDB and FamilySchedulerContext.
Also after doing testing with the Schedule Generator it seems that using 4 or 5 for max tasks per person worked best for generating a assignment for every task (or atleast the ones I have seeded into the project)
